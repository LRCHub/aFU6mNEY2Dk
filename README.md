Futureland
I need a place to go
Where dreams are solid gold
Watch up in blue sky
A shiny city bright
Here it callin'
See it comin'
In the share of worlds to be
So can you feel it in the wind
Risin' like a tide of energy?
Futureland
And I believe
The night is over,
let the light fall on me
Futureland
All history
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
Futureland
And I believe
The night is over,
let the light fall on me
Futureland
All history
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
Imagination bold
Creates a different world
Sharp and full of life
My atoms goin' wild
Here it callin'
See it comin'
In the share of worlds to be
So can you feel it in the wind
Risin' like a tide of energy?
Futureland
And I believe
The night is over,
let the light fall on me
Futureland
All history
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
Futureland
And I believe
The night is over,
let the light fall on me
Futureland
All history
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
Futureland
I need a place to go
Where dreams are solid gold
Watch up in blue sky
A shiny city bright
Here it callin'
See it comin'
In the share of worlds to be
So can you feel it in the wind
Risin' like a tide of energy?
Futureland
Futureland
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
Futureland
And I believe
The night is over,
let the light fall on me
Futureland
All history
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
Futureland
Futureland
Here it callin'
See it comin'
Futureland
And I believe
The night is over,
let the light fall on me
Futureland
All history
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
Futureland
And I believe
The night is over,
let the light fall on me
Futureland
All history
is just a dream
A fire burnin' so high
